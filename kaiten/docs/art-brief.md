# Kaiten art brief

The game currently uses the flat SVG placeholders in `art/`. This brief replaces them with painted art in
a warm, hand-painted, Miyazaki-inspired animated-film look. That means a cosy little sushi bar, glossy
fresh fish, round friendly faces and soft afternoon light.

**How to use it with ChatGPT.** Ask for **contact sheets, not single images**. One image holds a
whole set in a grid. That is far faster than one picture per prompt, and sets made together come out
consistent (same faces, line weight, light and colours). Paste the **style brief** once, then send one
sheet request at a time. Save each finished sheet as `art/sheets/sheet-NN-name.png` and run
`python3 tools/slice_sheets.py`. It cuts every cell out and saves it under the file name listed here,
which is the name the game already loads.

> A note on wording: image tools often refuse or water down prompts that name a studio or a living
> artist. The brief below describes the look instead of naming it. That gets you there more reliably.

## Style brief (paste this first)

> You are illustrating **Kaiten**, a cosy board game set in a small neighbourhood conveyor-belt sushi
> bar in Japan. Chefs in white coats and coloured headbands work behind a hinoki-wood counter while
> plates glide past on a steel belt.
>
> **Look**: hand-painted animated-film storybook art. Soft gouache and watercolour texture, gentle
> hand-drawn ink outlines of varying weight, warm late-afternoon light from the upper left, soft
> painted shadows, a little paper grain. Food looks glossy, fresh and delicious: translucent fish with
> visible grain and a wet highlight, rice with individual plump grains, crisp dark nori. Characters are
> round-faced, warm and expressive, with simple shapes and big kind eyes. Cosy, nostalgic and
> slightly whimsical. **Not** 3D-rendered, **not** photorealistic, **not** flat vector or clip art,
> **not** chibi-sticker style.
>
> **Palette**: hinoki wood `#E6CD9F`, deep indigo `#21385B`, vermilion lacquer `#C2342A`,
> nori green `#21362A`, salmon `#F07A35`, tuna red `#C11F3B`, wasabi green `#8DBB42`,
> warm cream `#FCF7EC`. Team colours for the chefs' headbands and aprons: blue `#2F62C4`,
> red `#D24A2F`, yellow `#D9A51A`, teal `#1F9488`.
>
> **Contact sheets**: always deliver a set as ONE contact sheet: a single image holding a strict grid
> of equal cells separated by thin, even cream gutters, filled left to right, top to bottom, in the
> order given. Every cell is a complete, separate illustration. Nothing crosses into a neighbouring
> cell. Leave spare cells plain cream.
>
> **Inside each cell**: one subject, centred, filling about 75% of the cell, on a plain flat
> background in the colour asked for (no scenery, no props unless listed, no drop shadow running off
> the edge). **No text, letters, numbers, kanji, captions, labels, borders, frames, watermarks or
> logos anywhere.** Each image must still read clearly when shown small (food at 48 px, faces at
> 32 px).
>
> **Consistency**: same painting style, outline weight, lighting and palette across every cell and
> every sheet. Characters are original invented people.

### How to ask for each sheet

> Using the style brief, make **one contact sheet**: a [COLS] × [ROWS] grid of square cells on a
> [W] × [H] image, thin cream gutters, filled left to right, top to bottom in this order:
> [paste the cell list].

If one cell comes out wrong, ask for the whole sheet again with a note ("cell 6 needs a nori band")
rather than a single replacement, so the set stays consistent.

| 2 | The same icon with the plate shrunk to the central 60% (safe zone for Android's masked icons), ground filling the whole cell | `icons/maskable-512.png` |

## After slicing

`tools/slice_sheets.py` writes every file above. To switch the game over from the SVG placeholders,
change `ART_EXT` near the top of the UI script in `kaiten.html` from `'svg'` to `'webp'`.
The textures (`tex-*.webp`) and the new icons can then be wired into the CSS and `manifest.webmanifest`.
